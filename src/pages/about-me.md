# About Me

<img src = "..//img/headshot.png" width="100%" />

Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Lena Lankas and I am a junior studying computer science, business, and math at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I'm a startup co-founder as well as a product management intern at a sports technology company. So although UI design is not something I see in my future career path, the field is fascinating and parallel to my long term professional goals. UI helps you think like a customer and ideate ways to make their lives easier...skills that will not be lost on me as I take on the product space. Throughout this portfolio, you'll find blog posts detailing my learnings, my opinions, some random app ideas, and just about any other thought my brain produced during this semester of UI exploration. Take a look around!

But first, here's my resume! Oooooo! Ahhhhhh!
