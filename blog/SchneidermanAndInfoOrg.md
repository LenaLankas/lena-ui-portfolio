# Exploring the Amazon

Learning about affordances and signifiers has made me pay attention more to the everyday things I interact with. More specifically, I'm noticing these interactions within my new apartment building. I'm noticing symbolism that makes me think I can take a certain action (signifiers) and then noticing whether or not those actions are actually possible (affordances) -- or sometimes the other way around. All my interactions are seemingly subconscious, yet each action I make is backed by some sort of thoughtful design. My favorite interaction I consciously thought about since putting on my designer hat is one I had with my front door:



!!!! I'll put the photo here when I transfer over to a blog post !!!!



As you can see, there's a lot of signifiers that aided me in understanding the intended affordances. First and foremost, I must address the push/pull dilemma. With a lot of doors, it is not immediately clear whether you should push or pull. However, this door is clear. You can clearly see that the external side has a handles and the internal side has a bar. Based on my history, I'm able to quickly come up with a hypothesis: to get inside I must pull and to go outside I must push. But even if it weren't for my learned behavior, the design of both sides helps encourage the desired actions. The bar looks like a really large button...something you would push against. Trying to pull that bar would not feel very natural. It is also very obvious that the handle is meant to be grabbed by a hand. You can also notice the left handle's paint is coming off, showing that it has been interacted with a lot.* These interactions, though not consciously thought about, are made simple because of good design.



The signifiers in this photo, however, broke me out of my subconscious state. The door handle was clearly broken. Despite being so obviously unusable, the apartment still put up a sign to deter people from trying to open the door. I made a joke to my roommate saying "Thank god they put that sign there or I would have never thought to use the other handle". We laughed, but I can't help but think that there were a handful of individuals that might have tried the handle if not for the sign...



*Food for thought: why is the paint coming off the left handle and not the right? Was the right one replaced recently? Are more people carrying objects (their phones) with their right hand so opt to use their left to open doors? Is it because that door is the closest one when walking from campus? Or, my personal hypothesis, is it because that door is directly next to the scanner we need to interact with in order to get into the building?

Arguably one of the easiest types of interfaces to get wrong is shopping websites. Whether for shoes or a house, when you aren't able to search for what you need, frustration is quick to follow. There are lots of websites that get roasted for their totally unintuitive designs (*cough cough* Zara *cough cough*). After reading Schneiderman's article, I can see now that all annoyances are rooted in a lack of one of the following: Overview, Zoom, Filter, Details-on-demand, Relate, History, Extract.



Though I could go through and talk about where some companies fall short in these areas (*cough cough* Zara *cough cough*), I find it better to discuss one that does it right. Amazon is a great example (and a website I think almost everyone has used once in their life).



----> Note: on the blog this will look better because I'll actually insert and interweave the screenshots.



Overview: Immediately after navigating to Amazon.com I know I'm in a place where I can shop for just about any item. My eye first is caught by the seemingly "recommended for you" product categories. Well -- actually -- my eye is first drawn to the abnormally large twisters ad...but we're going to ignore that for blog purposes. Back to the "recommended for you": the algorithm clearly knows I'm a college student who likes beauty and has pets. They've highlighted the things I might be interested in, giving me a starting place to zoom in on.



Zoom: However, if that's not what I'm looking for, they've provided me a navbar of different areas to dive into. Or, if I know what I want, a search bar located right at the top. They've given me three different options for zooming in. And somehow, they did this without overwhelming me.



Filter: I ended up searching "cute dresses" to get myself zoomed in. Now, I'm brought to a pagination of dresses. What's most interesting, however, is my filters. They aren't simply price and color. The filters are specific to dresses, allowing me to tailor to my size, desired silhouette, desired length, and more. They give me seemingly unlimited ways to customize search and find exactly what I want.



Detail-on-demand: My favorite feature on amazon is how easily I can get details. The hardest part about online shopping is clicking in and out on each thing I'm interested in. Amazon not only displays most of the worthwhile information (name, brand, price, delivery date), but also allows you to change colors on the dress without clicking in.



Relate: Amazon also does a great job of helping you narrow down your search based on items that are catching your eye. You might find a dress you like, like the one above, but don't yet think it's "the one". Amazon provides you with a scroll of related products that are around the same vibe. This tool has helped me on numerous occasions.



History: Not only does Amazon provide the basic breadcrumbs, but it also has a really convenient "browsing history tab". So no matter how far down the rabbit hole you went, you are always able to figure out where you started. Because at the end of the day, it's usually the first one you liked that really was "the one" after all.



Extract: Though not one I use often, Amazon has built in share options. So if I wear a dress and then someone asks me where it's from, it's super easy for me to click this icon and send it out.
