# Exploring the Amazon

Reading: Schneiderman and Info Org

Arguably one of the easiest types of interfaces to get wrong is shopping websites. Whether for shoes or a house, when you aren't able to search for what you need, frustration is quick to follow. There are lots of websites that get roasted for their totally unintuitive designs (*cough cough* Zara *cough cough*). After reading Schneiderman's article, I can see now that all annoyances are rooted in a lack of one of the following: Overview, Zoom, Filter, Details-on-demand, Relate, History, Extract.

Though I could go through and talk about where some companies fall short in these areas (*cough cough* Zara *cough cough*), I find it better to discuss one that does it right. Amazon is a great example (and a website I think almost everyone has used once in their life).

Overview: Immediately after navigating to Amazon.com I know I'm in a place where I can shop for just about any item. My eye first is caught by the seemingly "recommended for you" product categories. Well -- actually -- my eye is first drawn to the abnormally large twisters ad...but we're going to ignore that for blog purposes. Back to the "recommended for you": the algorithm clearly knows I'm a college student who likes beauty and has pets. They've highlighted the things I might be interested in, giving me a starting place to zoom in on.

Zoom: However, if that's not what I'm looking for, they've provided me a navbar of different areas to dive into. Or, if I know what I want, a search bar located right at the top. They've given me three different options for zooming in. And somehow, they did this without overwhelming me.

Filter: I ended up searching "cute dresses" to get myself zoomed in. Now, I'm brought to a pagination of dresses. What's most interesting, however, is my filters. They aren't simply price and color. The filters are specific to dresses, allowing me to tailor to my size, desired silhouette, desired length, and more. They give me seemingly unlimited ways to customize search and find exactly what I want.

Detail-on-demand: My favorite feature on amazon is how easily I can get details. The hardest part about online shopping is clicking in and out on each thing I'm interested in. Amazon not only displays most of the worthwhile information (name, brand, price, delivery date), but also allows you to change colors on the dress without clicking in.

Relate: Amazon also does a great job of helping you narrow down your search based on items that are catching your eye. You might find a dress you like, like the one above, but don't yet think it's "the one". Amazon provides you with a scroll of related products that are around the same vibe. This tool has helped me on numerous occasions.

<img src = "..//img/AmazonHistory.jpeg" width="100%" />

History: Not only does Amazon provide the basic breadcrumbs, but it also has a really convenient "browsing history tab". So no matter how far down the rabbit hole you went, you are always able to figure out where you started. Because at the end of the day, it's usually the first one you liked that really was "the one" after all.

Extract: Though not one I use often, Amazon has built in share options. So if I wear a dress and then someone asks me where it's from, it's super easy for me to click this icon and send it out.
