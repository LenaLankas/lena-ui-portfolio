# The Interview.

Interviewing is a skill. It takes practice and preparation. Every time after an interview - without fail - I'll be in the shower or drifting to sleep when genius strikes and I realize "I wish I would have answered that question like this instead". Or  somewhere I end up learning new information a few days/weeks/months later and think to myself "man I wish I knew that when I interviewed". There's always going to be those post-interview coulda, shoulda, wouldas. Now, some of it can be attributed to the natural progression of yourself as a professional. You can't always expect to have all the answers early in your career. You're supposed to learn as you go. However, there is a good portion of that regret that can be mitigated if you anticipate it.

1. Prepare Common Questions

The first step is collecting a list of questions and writing them out on a document. You'll want to account for everything, even if you think there's a 0.001% you get asked it. I always start with the basics, like "tell me about yourself?" or "what are you strengths/weaknesses?" Next I start looking up youtube videos and articles about the broader role and write those down, like "what is your design process?" or "tell me about a time you received negative feedback". Lastly, I reach out to individuals who have worked at or interviewed at the company in question. This is where you'll find the more niche questions, like "Tell me about a time a customer interview changed your original design." or "Tell me about a time you disagreed with someone at work."
2. Answer Common Questions

After you have a running list of those questions, go through and outline your answers. Figure out what experiences you've had will strongly tie to the question and demonstrate your abilities. The best responses will also include metrics. If you can't decide between two answers, choose the one that has stats to back it. Ex. "By implementing this design change, I was able to increase click through rates by 10%." My pro-tip for answering these questions is to first figure out what stories you want to tell. Then work backwards and see how you can manipulate your storytelling to answer the question. You can tell one story a million different ways to answer a million different questions.
3. Use the STAR Method

With that being said, don't just give an answer...TELL A STORY. I'm not going to give a tutorial on this because the internet is already over-saturated with STAR method how-to's, but look it up! 
4. Match Your Portfolio to the Job Posting 

If you're applying for a job, make sure you are qualified for the job. This may seem obvious, but a simple oversight like this could make or break your interview. Cross reference the bullet points on the job requirements with your portfolio. If they are asking for someone who has experience with Figma, you should sure as heck have something in your portfolio that showcases your experience with Fignma. And if there is something missing that they required, figure it out (display something virtually similar or start learning it or be able to speak to skills not listed that would provide impact or something)! You need to fully understand why/who they are hiring so you can be sure you're the right fit. If you're not confident that you should be the hire, they won't be either. 
5. Focus on the Underlying Messages 

When you're telling a story about the app redesign you created your senior year, the interviewer doesn't really care about the app redesign. The interviewer is looking for things that signal yourself as a designer. They are looking for how you find inspiration and what processes you use. Make sure those are apparent! Don't just talk about the end result. Talk about how you reached that result and the pivots that came along the way. This somewhat goes hand in hand with point #3. You want to tell a story, but make sure you aren't giving a cliffnotes version that only speaks from a hindsight point of view. Be brief, but don't skip out on details that show you are someone who listens to customers, thinks iteratively, and leans into creativity. 
6. Understand the Problem

On the same note, make sure you make it apparent that you understand the problem at hand. This is especially pertinent in design challenges. Whether a 10-minute whiteboard exercise or a 3-day take home challenge, make sure you don't have tunnel vision on the aesthetics. Yes designers should make work that is nice to look at, but more importantly they create something that solves a problem. So when given a challenge, ask questions that you would ask a customer/client. Make sure you have a full understanding of the pains and gains, and design accordingly. Then when presenting your design, be sure to point out the rationale behind your choices and how it ties back to the problem to be solved. This applies to story telling as well. 
7. Prepare Questions

Interviews are about giving good answers and asking good questions. The second part of that sentence often gets overlooked. Preparing questions not only helps you as an individual, but also makes you stand out as a candidate. Being prepared with questions shows you are serious about the role and have done your research. But you shouldn't just ask questions to ask questions, be genuine with your curiosity. Remember you are interviewing them just as much as they are interviewing you! The questions you ask will help you understand what you are getting into. Some good examples are:
    - What departments would I work closely with?
    - Describe a recent project you oversaw and the process?
    - What does the career path look like for someone in this role?
    - How would my performance be measured in this role? What does success look like?
8. Connect with the Interviewer

At the end of the day, your interviewer is a person too. You should be engaging with them. Show active listening. Ask questions about the company, but also ask them about themselves. Creating a genuine connection with them will help you in more than a few ways...
    - They could have sat through 3 other interviews before this, or 50. Regardless of the number, building a connection will help you stand out when writing their reviews. It's likely your competition also has a dazzling portfolio. 
    - Companies are hiring for skill and cultural fit. Especially in 2024, the latter is increasingly important. Being a great designer doesn't necessarily mean you'll be a great fit. You want your interviewer to be confident in your ability to integrate into the company quickly and bring positive energy. 
    - You might not get the job. That doesn't mean you are a bad designer. That just means there was someone who was a better fit. But making a genuine connection with the interview can open you up to future opportunities, help you build your network to find other opportunities, or simply leave you with a new friend.
