# If Lost, Return To ____ 

Reading this chapter of Don't Make Me Think was very timely. Just yesterday, I had the exact experience described in the reading. I went to Walmart before my philanthropy event to do some last minute shopping. On my list: raffle tickets, baskets, and giftcards.

My decision making process started even before I got to Walmart. I first started by googling "raffle tickets in Lincoln". I got a few different options, but Walmart was the closest and cheapest. I then clicked on the link to confirm they had them in stock at that location. Not only did I get confirmation that they were in stock, but I also got a preview of exactly what aisle to find them in. I walked into the store and found them almost immediately. They were in a crafting section, which I suppose seems fitting, but I never would have found on my own. This was a very streamlined experience and took me a total of 30 seconds. 

However, frustration set in when I tried looking for the decorative baskets. I didn't do any research beforehand because I knew Walmart would have them...I just didn't know where. Home? Gifts? Storage? I glanced down every aisle nearby, but none seemed to match. I tried looking it up online, but baskets was too broad of a keyword. I then walked around a little more. Then I found a worker to direct me. They took me down all the same aisles and couldn't find them. Finally she pulled out her little device and found the exact aisle number. It was one of the aisles I had passed 3 times at this point. I missed them originally because they were located on the very end amongst laundry baskets and bulky storage bins (which makes sense...but also doesn't).

Lastly, I searched for the giftcards. Or, more accurately, I headed to checkout expecting to see them by the register. From what I'm used to, they are on a very obvious end cap or part of the "pre-checkout" display. I wandered from checkout lane to checkout lane keeping my eyes peeled. After not finding them in the aisles or on the end caps, I turned my attention to the displays directly behind the registers. I glanced past them a few times, but finally realized they were on a separate display. However, all of the displays were very crowded and had no signals that were identifiable unless you were standing right in front of it.

I learned a few things
- Good UI helps you do the internet better. Great UI helps you do the internet and real life better. Without even intentionally seeking it out, I was able to walk into Walmart knowing my direct path to the tickets.
- Categorizing things are hard. One item, like a basket, can fall under many justifiable categories. You'll probably never find the most perfect combination of categories, which is why search options are important.
- Don't nest things too far down. People will glance at the first few items to see if they are in the right place, and then move on. People won't find their decorative baskets if you put a large list of laundry hampers before them.
- People expect the expected. If every other store puts their giftcards in one spot, you should also put your giftcards there. 
- Don't make people feel claustrophobic. It's hard to search for a needle in a haystack. It's even harder in a really compact one.
- Make signs big! And in the air! So that you can see them from far away or when something is in front of the display!
