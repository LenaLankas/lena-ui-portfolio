# Window surfing

Homepage is to surfing as window is to shopping.

The analog and digital world are alike in many ways. Like discussed in our "navigation and values" reading, there's many similarities between how we search in stores and how we search on the web. And this searching starts earlier than we may be aware of. Before we even step into the store (or dive into the website), we must first decide if we even want to go in (or dive deeper). The comparisons are almost one-to-one.

In most cases, you enter the mall with a mission. In most cases, you also go on the internet with a mission. 

You first consult the directory and look for a store that may fit your needs. On the web, you scroll the search results and look for a link that may fit your needs.

The sign on the door/building/wall tells you you have arrived at your destination. The logo on the website tells you you have arrived at your destination.

You then look through the window and take a first glance at the content...just like you look around the content of a website. THis is the most important part. Not only does it tell you if you should enter, but it also tells you where you should head first. 

You also check for signs of life. Is there an employee inside? Are there recent updates that signify it's an active website?

You might also ask yourself "is this a reputable place to be searching?" Seeing people in a store is kind of like seeing testimonials on a landing page. If other people trust you, I should too.

Within a split second, you've made a decision on whether or not this place is worth your while. That's why website maintanence is so important. No one goes into the store that has unfolded clothes strewn about carelessly. They just go over a few stores (or down a few scrolls).
