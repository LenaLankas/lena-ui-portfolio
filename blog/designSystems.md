# Life is like a box of legos

Designing a platform is like building a lego set.

In order to build a coherent structure, your building block needs to fit together. Uniformity is key. However, you can't be too uniform. There's a balance to be aware of when building unique and engaging work that also is structurally sound and aesthetically pleasing. If every block where the same size, you would be very limited creatively. But if every block were totally unique, it would be difficult to put pieces together. This balance lies in the parts of the whole.

Intentional design is made up of reusable parts that introduce variety (without introducing inconsistency). With legos, you have a range of colors to choose from that come in a handful of defined sizes. This gives you room for creative freedom while still being systematic. The same can be said in design. Style guides define typographies, frequently used components, and size/color requirements. This allows designers to mix-and-match. The organization also increases efficiency, giving them more time to play around with iterations. Not only that, but it also creates consistency for end users. Going on a well designed website that is dependable is a breathe of fresh air.

This is helpful for me as a designer to know when a guide is necessary. Some one-off projects may not warrant a template. However, more times than not, it is good practice to work through an outline of components and language. This will make me more intentional about my final design and ensure consistency in my work (while saving time in the long term). 

I mean think about, the lego death star starts with a plain black brick. Just like all good designs usually start with a simple text box.
