# The Secret Formula

<img src = "..//img/secretformula.jpeg" width="100%" />

Well well well...look at you! What a curious individual you are to have found this post. I set the date to new years day of 2023, so that it would be buried beneath my many blog posts. Even before the example blog post that I intentionally put as a red herring to deter you from entering (or is it because I get an error everytime I try to delete it? We'll never know!). Regardless, color me impressed. I applaud you for your thoroughness (unless you're Carly...then in that case I submitted the link to this blog to TeachFront which makes finding this much less impressive). Anyways let's get into the content. 

Well, actually I'm not done being sarcastic yet. This is very meta don't you think? Me writing a blog post for my portfolio...to explain how this portfolio came to be...kind of funny when you think about it. It's like those "How it's Made" shows where you watch a hotdog beind made and suddenly you become vegetarian (Fun Fact: I'm vegetarian). While I don't think reading this will make you averse to all portfolios for the rest of your life, I will warn you that it spoils some of the magic. I just want you to take a second to remember what life was like before you looked at my portfolio with a close eye.

No seriously...think! reminisce! Remember that one blog post? The one about the ninja creami? Ugh...those were the days...

Ok, you done yet?

Ok, good.

Now to the meat and potatoes for real (or pasta and potatoes in my case...you know...cause I'm vegetarian):


### Clean, intuitive navigation
I wanted to keep things familiar. I didn't stray too far from the original docusaurus implementation. Partially because it wouldn't let me, and partially because I think they gave me a great foundation. However, I did add some personalization here and there that I think is worth calling out.
- I added redirects on the homepage to what I consider the three most important sections: my first blog, my favorite blog, and my project. The favorite blog was especially important for me because of the limitations with the built-in blog structure. I was really proud of my museum walkthrough blog, so made sure it was called out.
- In projects, I embedded my figma so that the user could independently navigate through my entire design process. The dropdown menu in the top corner lets them view my design system, mockup, prototype, prototype after colleague assessment, and prototype after user interviews. 
- I made my headings and titles fun, but meaningful. I want the user to feel engaged and empowered as they journey through my portfolio. I don't want to tell them where to go, rather I want to ignite their curiosity and implore them to explore more (I mean that's how you ended up here, right? Unless you're Carly).

### Intentional color choices
I associate a lot of different feelings with this specific color of red: commanding, professional, mature, strength, luxury, power. The driving factor, however, was my deep roots as a Husker fan. Something about scarlet will always do it for me. I messed around with the color picker until I found a shade that would work well throughout the profile, not be overwhelming, and still be accessible.


### Harmony between affordances and signifiers
My portfolio has many affordances and signifiers to assist in navigation. For example, on the blog nav bar the current post is highlighted in red. As you move your mouse over other titles, they turn red responsively to show focus. The cursor also turns to a mouse so users know what is and isn't clickable. 

### Accessibility and Usability
The contrast on my portfolio meets accessibility standards. As described in the color section, I was very intentional with these choices to not only keep things clean, but also make it accessible for all users. Along those same lines, I kept a font that is sans-serif to account for visual and comprehension impairments. The dark mode feature also gives options for people to view with different intensity levels. Most importantly, my portfolio is structured. For individuals using a screen reader, they will also get the most pertinent information first and be set up for navigation success. I also kept naming conventions consistent throughout the portfolio, whether that's alt-image text or link subtitles. 

### Proper attribution of others' work
I did this! Or at least I hope I did! That'd be real awkward if not. 

### Intentional integration of values
I added a cutesie little section on the homepage to give an overview of my values as a designer. These descriptions not only give the reader a better understanding of what I find important for design thinking, but also helps introduce them to my voice. Throughout my portfolio I like to keep a conversation tone; a tone that is inviting and fun. I don't want someone to feel like I chatGPTed something pretentious and slapped it on the page. I want it to feel authentic. 

### The gist
Overall, I think my portfolio looks pretty snazzy for someone who's not super into design and development (at least as a full time hobby/career/passion). Though I do like to dabble. And while I could talk about the actual design of the portfolio for a while, I think I'm most proud of the content. I think it's very representative of me. I don't like a whole lot of fluff. I want my thoughts and writing to be the shining star. Hopefully that comes across. 

The End.
