# Spotify Wrapped in Different Colors

Spotify is one of my favorites apps in terms of UI and branding. They go viral every year near the holidays because of their "spotify wrapped" visuals. The company clearly is all about the aesthetics and graphic design, but I thought it would be fun to put a twist on their well thought out interface.

The original Spotify is not a harmonious color scheme, thought that doesn't mean it isn't effective. Black dominates most of the interface, allowing the white text to jump off the screen and "Spotify green" icons to catch your eye. Based on the pantone reading, this green is supposed to make us feel lush and fertile, with therapeutic benefits. Though the association is supposed to be nature, I feel as though against the black background it's more action packed and inviting. The black can take on a handful of associations given the scenario (aka what music you're listening to): powerful, gloomy, elegance, etc. The white has great contrast off this, making for very high readability. I think the designers were hoping to blend into the background, allowing for the music to take center stage. Many parts of the application use shades of the album cover to complement the artist/song before you (the current song background and the gradient). I think they want to serve as a backdrop for their art, allowing the pictures and names to be the focal point. The green is a call to action to press play and enjoy.

For my first color treatment, I tried to "apple music"-ify the Spotify UI. Apple music takes almost a complete opposite positioning, reversing the black and whites and choosing red as an accent color. The red accents biologically draw our attention. Red is commanding and un-ignorable, yet the undertones are diverse. Passion, rage, love, elegance, courage. Again, how these colors are interpreted could vary greatly based on what playlist is turned on. This is not a harmonious color scheme and I don't prefer it over Spotify. The white stands out too much that the other elements fade into it. It is too stark

For my second color treatment, I chose an "active" color scheme from the Pantone book. This purpose of these schemes is to promote bursts of energy. The colors themselves are electric. Against the black background, everything demands attention. In this iteration, I changed some of the color combinations so that different components were highlighted. I did this for aesthetic purposes, but also to make the  "engagement" buttons more prominent (following, playing, and exploration). Making these elements of utmost importance would help break users out of their normal flow and help highlight features that they may normally neglect. Overall, I actually think this color scheme is more digestible than the first. I don't mind it.

For my last color treatment, I chose a color scheme that combined "romantic" and "soothing". In this version, the pink text becomes the focal point. It encourages you to read every section and sub header, guiding you along the musical journey. I also like that in this version some of the icons are more subtle. The tiny icons next to each song (originally green) are a little too prominent for my liking in the original design. Yes, I want to know what songs I already have added to my library when viewing an artist, but I don't think that's the most important thing I should be drawn to. Blue is meant to be soothing yet inspiring, which makes it a perfect backdrop for the music I listen to. The only downside is that blue is the most commonly used branding color, making it less of a "stand-out" like Spotify's electric green. This color scheme actually ended up being my favorite, but it looked almost too thematic. I made a fourth version that kept the blues, but changed the pinks to white. I actually quite liked how it turned out. It gives the same effect as the original where the musicians art truly takes focus. However, in this version the contrast between the text and the background isn't quite as jarring as the black/white/green. I found it most effective because of that, and because branding wise it fits well with all demographics and genres (whereas the others were a little too playful). 

Which was your favorite? What about your least favorite?
