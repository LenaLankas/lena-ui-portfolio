# A Rant

Blog post? Rant? Same thing! I saw an opportunity, and I'm going to take it.

Today I had a run in with some physical constraints. Or -- more accurately -- a lack thereof. Allow me to set the scene: My roommate has a ninja creami. This viral kitchen appliance turns anything into a sweet treat. A magical machine that can turn my protein shakes into soft serve? Yes please! The only downside is that you must freeze your liquid 24 hours in advance (good thing I'm patient). I prepared my concoction yesterday evening in preparation for my movie night tonight. I waited all day in anticipation. Finally, I got home from dinner and set up my creami as I normally would: take plastic container out of fridge, place plastic container into ninja creami, click into place, turn on machine, press "softserve" button. And, like I always do, I walked away to go about my night routine while it went to work. What's usually a 5 minute process got rudely interrupted by screeching (both human and machine). The ninja creami had gone rouge! I ran over to the smell of burning plastic. The owner of the ninja creami, Ava, turned to me. "Did you do something wrong? Did you forget a step?". I second guessed myself, wondering if maybe I imagined hearing the *click* or forgot to take the lid off. Nope. Upon investigation we discovered that the issue was with the container itself. You see, our other roommate had bought extra containers off amazon so we could maximize our ninja creami creations. What we failed to realize is that these containers were ever so slightly smaller than the original, causing the blade to tear up the plastic rim. But how would we have realized? It fit in the container like the original. It *click*ed into the machine like the original. It started like the original. If all signs pointed to it working like the original, why did it not? I blame physical constraints.
