# Museum Walkthrough

<img src = "..//img/RanchPhoto.jpeg" width="100%" />

I took to the Sheldon Art Museum to gain inspiration. The museum is filled with works of varying mediums, styles, and messages. I found myself pulled most towards this photo of 4 cowboys. I could feel the photo just by looking at it. It reminded me of summer nights where the sun goes down way past its bed time and creates a nostalgic warm feeling. And although it felt very much like a midwest summer, it actually was taken on a Texas ranch near the Mexican border. "Fragment II: Cattle Drive at Perdiz Creek Ranch (Ranches at Reservoir), Marfa, Texas" is a work from An-My Le's exapnsive series, Silent General. She explores the complexity of living and working in American borderlands during times of rapid social and political change. The description on the wall emphasized her immersive process. This photo was not posed, but rather snapped during a break for the ranchers. This is very evident in her work and stuck out to me immediately. Looking at the photo felt like I had just walked up a few seconds after someone cracked a dry-humor joke. 

It's a beautiful photo, so it's no surprise that there are covert design principles at play. 

Rule of thirds: This photo has very clear segmentations. The dirt covers the bottom third, the horizon line and cowboys take up the middle space, and the sky along the top. One group of cowboys lie on the intersection point and the other seems to be right in the middle. What draws my eye most, however, is the sun shining bright in the top right intersection point. 

Direction of the eyes: The sun catches my eye initially. The rays of the sun then direct my focus to the cowboys, as if it was put up there to intentionally highlight them. So although it may be obvious that the cowboys are the dominant visual element, I don't think I would feel the same way about this photo if it weren't for the serendipitous sun placement. 

Emotive colors: The main colors I see in this photo are brown, green, and bright gold. The brown is pretty dominant, signaling humility and groundedness. The green adds to the earthy nature and signals restfulnes. However, what's most powerful to me is the color I made up: "bright gold". What is really just some light yellow and orange tones, is something colloquially knwon as golden hour. Something about it brings nostalgia and a warm feeling. It brings a sense of calm as a day ends and a new one starts. 



The reason I chose this photo is because I could feel it. It genuinely took me back to summer times in the middle of nowhere with the sun warming your skin. When I open the weather app, I don't feel it. I see a number that I don't understand. One of my biggest struggles in life is reading and interpreting the weather app. Truly. I open it expecting to know what to wear or know how to plan my day, but I never accomplish that goal. I need visuals. I need imagery and a relative comparison. Does it feel like a hot summer day where you escape to the shade? Or a cold fall football game where you layer up in order to stay until the clock hits 0? Or maybe, if you're in Nebraska, it's somehow both in one day. 

I need a weather app that takes me back to these feelings and emotions so I can prepare for the day. Numbers don't really tell me much. My proposed application would use images as the main source of communication. You would open up your phone and see a picture on display that describes the weather in real time. I envision these photos being sourced in two ways: from an in-app photography database or from the user's personal camera roll. The app would compare the current weather status and the data from your photo -- specifically time, date, and location -- to display photos from a time when there were similar weather conditions. For example, if it is a warm day with a slight breeze, a photo from when you went mini-golfing two years ago might be on display in the background. The intent is that the photos will take you back to that day and give you context clues that aid in decision making. Not only is it more insightful and intuitive than numbers, but it also serves as a fun way to reminisce. You can add a timeline widget on the bottom and scrolling through it will show different images that correspond. You can also add widgets that would show temperature specifics or suggestions on what to wear. The location widget would also provide more context about the photo. If using your camera roll, it will give an AI summary on what you did that day. If using the data base, it will prompt you to learn more about the photo and photographer. This will make checking the weather an immersive experience, not just a meaningless number analysis.

Something insightful I learned throughout this process is that this is actually a really great idea and I need to trademark it.
