# Thinking, Fast and Slow

#ApproximateAnalogy

Declarative memory and procedural memory are to "The Design of Everyday Things" as Systems 1 and 2 are to "Thinking, Fast and Slow".

This summer, I read a book called "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman (or at least I read about 2/3 of it until I decided I was bored of it). The book is focused on how we process information. System 1 is our fast, automatic, intuitive responses. When we see "2+2" we immediately think of "4". We reached that conclusion quickly without much conscious thought. I think both authors would agree that declarative memory and system 1 are talking about similar (or even the same) process. On the other hand, System 2 is slow and deliberate. It requires conscious and intentional effort to provide an answer to the question...like the example about opening a door in your house from 3 houses ago. System 2 requires procedural memory. I find it interesting to see how this book about psychology I read is already being applied to my coursework this semester. Maybe I should have read the whole thing...
