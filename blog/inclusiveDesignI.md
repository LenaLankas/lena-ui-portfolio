# There is an "I" in Accessibility

This reading really reasonated with me. I found myself too often being able to think of examples where I was involved in a project that was taking shortcuts or simply not thinking about accessibility. As someone who falls under the "young able-bodied" category that Krug references, it gave me a chance to reflect on my own inaction. It's not that accessibility was something I avoid, but it definitely has not been top of mind for me when thinking through product features and designs. I am someone who gets especially wrapped up in aesthetics. The way certain colors, fonts, and element sizes interact with eachother make me very uncomfortable. I can think of many times where I've manipulated presentations or UIs to be more suited to my liking, but now looking back I can recognize that it might have made things more difficult for someone else. A specific example is recently with some release meeting slides I was making. We had a slide with a significant amount of text on a blank background. The color contrast was too stark for our liking, so we went for a monochromatic look (dark red text, light red background). And although this looked nice on the eyes, it made for reduced readability.

A particularly interesting use case I didn't think about was games. A lot of online games are based entirely on sight and slight color/icon distinctions. This makes for a really terrible experience for colorblind and other visual impairments. The problem solving part also heavily relies on visual aid/pattern recognition. It makes me wonder how (or if) these games would adjust to become accessible. I would be interested to learn more about accessibility in gaming.
