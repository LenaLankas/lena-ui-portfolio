# Color Dictionary

My word: Definitions

"The Complete Color Harmony, Pantone Edition: Expert Color Information For Professional Results" is a book that defines something we normalize in our everyday lives. Color is a fascinating phenomenom, but we rarely think about the different mechanisms behind it. This portion of the book reads more like a dictionary. Definitions upon definitions to describe how colors come to be. Individually, each definition makes sense. Yet it's very hard to rap your brain around them all and predict what certain interactions might produce. What's even more difficult is when certain words, like "shade", are used colloquially but mean an entirely different thing by definition. Our brain isn't hardwired to understand how color is created, but maybe that's the beauty of it.
