# UIUN Summit Recap

The UIUN Summit is an accessibility workshop intended to get young designers thinking about UI accessibility in a new light. Each member of the workshop was tasked to represent a different group to be considered during the design process. I was the representative for Blindness and the other attendees were dyslexia, color blindness, baby boomers, GenZ and first time voters, children under 13, non-native speakers (ESL), photosensitive, anxiety, hand tremors, and trauma/PTSD. This group coming together made for robust conversations around accessibility and helped us better evaluate the requirements we should hold sites accountable for. The specific site under scrutinity for this year's summit was the Sarpy County election commission site. 

In order to best represent the blind community, I researched their needs and best practices for design considerations. The biggest takeaway was that designing for the blind user in mind is a really good frame of reference for a designer. Many of the accommodations they require overlap with the other groups in the UIUN's requirements. Alt-text images help the blind individual make sense of the website elements, but also benefit those with dyslexia, color blindness, and children under 13. Keyboard navigation is incredibly important to making a website accessible for the blind, but it also is vital for those with hand tremors. But that isn't all. There are a handful of other design techniques that are necessary for accessibility. Orderly page structure, navigation hierarchies, labeled components, and considerate use of color are to name just a few. For the Sarpy County website, I had a few specific asks: restructure the page content, make formatted sections screen readable, alt-text on all images, including a "skip to main content" bypass, and requiring a combination of text, icons, and colors for indicators. 

Listening to my peers made me more aware of the designs I see everyday. I anticipated my greatest allies would be those with other visual or physical impairments. On the other hand, I expected the more age and cognitive focused groups to have less overlap. This hypothesis was somewhat true, but honestly I think in general there was not a lot I disagreed this. The most important requirements for me were those related to screenreading. Prioritizing these changes and requests goes hand in hand with my greatest takeaways. 


My greatest takeaway is that accessibility is easy, it just requires thoughtfulness. Accessibility is especially easy when it's a forethought, not an after thought. The Sarpy County website wasn't being unaccessible on purpose or for aesthetic reasons. They just purely weren't thinking about it. It's clear the design wasn't very intentional because it wasn't a great user experience as someone who doesn't belong to one of the UIUN groups. This has inspired me to include accessibility as a fundamental requirement for all product designs and releases. It can't be a "we'll do this if we have time" or "we can leave this as a follow up".
