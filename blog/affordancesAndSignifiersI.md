# A Thank You to Captain Obvious

Learning about affordances and signifiers has made me pay attention more to the everyday things I interact with. More specifically, I'm noticing these interactions within my new apartment building. I'm noticing symbolism that makes me think I can take a certain action (signifiers) and then noticing whether or not those actions are actually possible (affordances) -- or sometimes the other way around. All my interactions are seemingly subconscious, yet each action I make is backed by some sort of thoughtful design. My favorite interaction I consciously thought about since putting on my designer hat is one I had with my front door:

As you can see, there's a lot of signifiers that aided me in understanding the intended affordances. First and foremost, I must address the push/pull dilemma. With a lot of doors, it is not immediately clear whether you should push or pull. However, this door is clear. You can clearly see that the external side has a handles and the internal side has a bar. Based on my history, I'm able to quickly come up with a hypothesis: to get inside I must pull and to go outside I must push. But even if it weren't for my learned behavior, the design of both sides helps encourage the desired actions. The bar looks like a really large button...something you would push against. Trying to pull that bar would not feel very natural. It is also very obvious that the handle is meant to be grabbed by a hand. You can also notice the left handle's paint is coming off, showing that it has been interacted with a lot.* These interactions, though not consciously thought about, are made simple because of good design.

The signifiers in this photo, however, broke me out of my subconscious state. The door handle was clearly broken. Despite being so obviously unusable, the apartment still put up a sign to deter people from trying to open the door. I made a joke to my roommate saying "Thank god they put that sign there or I would have never thought to use the other handle". We laughed, but I can't help but think that there were a handful of individuals that might have tried the handle if not for the sign...

*Food for thought: why is the paint coming off the left handle and not the right? Was the right one replaced recently? Are more people carrying objects (their phones) with their right hand so opt to use their left to open doors? Is it because that door is the closest one when walking from campus? Or, my personal hypothesis, is it because that door is directly next to the scanner we need to interact with in order to get into the building?
