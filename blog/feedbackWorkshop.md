# Let it go

My favorite piece of advice in this article was that we as individuals need to "learn to let go". When starting a project, we anchor it in beliefs formed during discovery. This is good for building a foundation. However, we have to recognize that anchors can go up and down for a reason. It's not a bad thing to anchor down, realize you're not where you want to be, bring the anchor back up, and look for somewhere else to drop it. 

It's very easy to slip into stubbornness. Whether falling victim to the sunk cost fallacy or just being a strongly opinionated person, it's not uncommon for designers to be resistent to change. Defensiveness becomes the default reaction. When we catch ourselves responding this way, we should go back to the initial objective. What do we want the user behavior to be? Zooming out like this will remind you what is really important (and what's not).
