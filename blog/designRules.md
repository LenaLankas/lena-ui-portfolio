# CSS Take the Wheel

My word: autopilot


In a world of information overload, it's normal to want to clock out. Unfortunately, it's not possible to shut ourselves off completely from this surplus of stimuli...at least it's not possible to do so and still be contributing members of society. However, it is possible to sit back and let autopilot kick in.

Autopilot is our unconscious decision-making system. It's the part of your brain that turns on when you're driving home from work and somehow make it from O street to Old Cheney without ever actively thinking. Autopilot allows us to complete tasks without increasing our cognitive load. We only have so much mental capacity to expend in one day, and some tasks (like online shopping) don't warrant our full attention.

The premise of "Don't Make Me Think" is entirely based on the human desire to live life on autopilot. My job is to make sure users can stay on autopilot for as long as possible.
