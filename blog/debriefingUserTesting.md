This specific reading really stuck out to me as valuable. Some of the quotes were entirely new concepts to me and helped change my frame of mind. Most of the quotes were things I've already heard or subconsciously knew, but have to be reminded of. I found myself wanting to highlight every other sentence to come back to. I've narrowed it down instead to every sixth sentence (give or take):

"The kinds of things you learn from focus groups...are things you should know before you begin designed or building anything..."

"After you've worked on a site for even a few weeks, you can't see it freshly anymore."

"Testing is like having friends visit from out of town"

"Even the worst test with the wrong user will show you important things you can do to improve your site."

"Most people assume that testing needs to be a big deal. But if you make it into a big deal, you won't do it early enough or often enoguh to get the most out of it."

"Spend on morning a month doing usability testing...then debrief over lunch."

"The purpose of this kind of testing isn't to prove anything...Do-it-yourself tests are a qualitative method whose purpose is to improve what you're builiding..."

"You can find more problems in half a day than you can fix in a month."

"Recruit loosely and grade on a curve"

"Experts are rarely insulted by something that is clear enough for beginners."

"...The facilitator's main job is to encourage them to think out loud as much as possible."

"Even before you begin designing your site, for instance, it's a good idea to do a test of compettive sites...you'll learn a lot about what works and doesn't work without having to design or build anything."

"Focus ruthlessly on fixing the most serious problems first."

"Take 'new feature' requests with a grain of salt."
