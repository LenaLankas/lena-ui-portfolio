# How to Make a Presentation (for Dummies)

![title](/img/graphicdesign.png)


1. The first step to making a presentation is deciding what you're going to talk about. When doing this, you aren't just considering the subject matter, but also the message you want your audience to walk away with. Motivated by this, you should create an outline. Focus on the flow. Give each bullet point on your list a slide. Don't make it fancy. 
2. Now think about the type of content that will be included under each bullet point. What do you want to say? Don't think about the visual aids yet. Think about what you would say if you had to give this same presentation in an elevator. 
3. Once you've thought about your spoken content, look back through your bullet points. Are any of them too weighted? You want to avoid cramming too much information into one slide. Spending too long on one slide will disengage your audience, and likely result in a cluttered visual aid to accompany it.
4. Now go back to slide one and flip through your outline. Does it flow good? Are you talking about relevant things on the relevant slides? Good. Now for the actual design part. 
5. On each slide, think about the snippet of content that most excites you. Is it a quote? Is it an analogy you made up? Is it an annecdote? If there was only one sentence your audience remembered, what would it be?
6. Once you've done that, brainstorm how you'll represent that nugget of gold visually. It can be a combination of words and images. Or it could just be one or the other. Whatever it is, make it meaningful enough that even the student with their headphones in can glance up for 5 seconds and know what message you're trying to send. 
7. The key to sending a message is making it clear. If that student is only glancing up for 5 seconds, they need to be able to filter out the important information from the noise. You as the presenter need to limit the noise. Go back through the slides and clarify. If your bullet points are too long, wordsmith ways to say the same thing...just simpler. If your charts are too distracting, think of ways to convey the same information with less elements. Iterate, iterate, iterate. 
8. Go back through the slides one last time...for good measure. If the slides feel like they are signaling you -- as opposed to serving as a crutch -- you probably did a good job. Remember, it's a visual aid. Your audience should still need you there to make it effective. If they can get all the same information from reading the slides, you're gonna see a lot more eyes on the screen than there are on you.
