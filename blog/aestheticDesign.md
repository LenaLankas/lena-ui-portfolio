# How to Make a Presentation (for Dummies)

- outline / main points
- break up so that only one point per slide
- include slides to recap
- per page, figure out what content to be said
- no figure out what of that actually warrants being written up there
- now can you replace any of that with an image?

- Now do that for every slide and make sure that only the first and last include a logo. DOn't be overkill.
