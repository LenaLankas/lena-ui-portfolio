# Opinions

One word to describe this reading? Opinions.

When thinking through design for a website, everyone is going to have a different opinion. 

Their opinion can be partially driven by personal tastes. "I'm a human and I don't like this, therefore other humans won't like this."

Their opinion can also be driven by their role and what they think needs to take priority based on their knowledge in the field. "I'm a marketing director and I think that placing this here will lead to a higher CTR."

In either case, the individual feels justified in their opinions and it will be hard to convince them otherwise. I like how the author called them "religious debates", because that really is true. These conversations get touchy and often lead to seemingly endless back-and-forth conversation that never comes to a conclusion.

The solve around this is user testing. This allows personal opinion to take a back seat, and data to take the front seat. User tests allow the stakeholders involved to prove (or disprove) their hypotheses in real time. Even better, it allows someone outside of the working environment to be the "bad guy" and break the tie.
