# I like boring colors

I like the more boring colors. Brown, white, taupe. At first glance, this seems very contrary to my personality. However, after reading through some of the descriptions and associations, it makes sense. The one I most closely aligned with was the "brown" description. Which makes sense, because although I always say white is my favorite color, neutral browns draw me in more so. My entire room is different shades of white and brown, and something about natural wood has always been my favorite interiors. Below is a list of the different statements I said "that's so me" to:

- Stability
- Steady, reliable character
- Keen sense of duty and responsibly
- Down-to-earth person
- Subtle sense of humor
- You prefer simplicity, comfort, quality, harmony, heart, and home
- Loyal friend
- Understanding but firm
- Strong views 
- Intolerant of others who think, talk, or act too quickly
- Strive to be a good money manager
- Drive a good bargain
- Find it difficult to be carefree and spontaneous
- Often rebel internally against accepting things the way they are
- Feel very uncomfortable about losing control
- Will work hard to change a situation that seems unjust or unfair
- Strong need for security and a sense of belonging

So yeah. Just about every sentiment stuck out to me.
