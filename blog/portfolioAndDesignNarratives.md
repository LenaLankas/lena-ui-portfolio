# Meta Portfolio

One's UI portfolio is essentially a resume, cover letter, behavioral interview, and technical interview wrapped into one neat package. Not only is it an artifact of significant works, but also a place to show personality and style. You need to establish yourself as an accomplished designer with meaningful projects, without overbearing the reader. There's a checklist to complete:

- Create a design system that represents you as a designer and person well
- Use that design system to create a portfolio landing page
- Introduce yourself (name, occupation, and a quirky designer statement)
- Decide what projects you want to highlight
- Make sure there are clear links to learn more about those projects (and if you are showing previews, make sure the thumbnails are cohesive)
- Include links for resume, contact information, and about me
- White space! Make sure you have enough of it! 
- Walk through your portfolio. Do you feel like it represents you well? Have a friend walk through your portfolio. Do they feel like it represents you well? 

You want to prove your competence as a designer as well as assert your values as one.
